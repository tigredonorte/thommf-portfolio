# S3-Only Portfolio Deployment Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## What's Been Configured

‚úÖ **S3 Static Website Hosting** - Your portfolio will be hosted directly from S3
‚úÖ **Public Access Policy** - Allows anyone to view your website
‚úÖ **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automated deployment from your main branch
‚úÖ **Terraform Infrastructure** - All AWS resources are managed as code
‚úÖ **IAM Roles & Policies** - Secure OIDC authentication for GitHub Actions

## Your Website URL

üåê **Website URL**: http://thommf-portfolio-personal-site.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## What Was Removed (For Future CloudFront PR)

‚ùå CloudFront distribution (account verification required)
‚ùå SSL certificate support (HTTPS)
‚ùå Custom domain support (thomfilg.com)
‚ùå Global CDN caching
‚ùå Route 53 DNS records

## Required GitHub Secrets

Make sure these are set as **Environment Secrets** in your `Production` environment:

- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: `thommf-portfolio-personal-site`
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: `arn:aws:iam::456808212788:role/GitHubActions-frontend-deployer-Role`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployment**:
   - Push to main branch or create a PR
   - Check GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
   - Verify your site loads at the S3 website URL

2. **Future CloudFront Setup** (separate PR):
   - Contact AWS Support to verify account for CloudFront
   - Set up SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager
   - Configure Route 53 hosted zone for thomfilg.com
   - Add CloudFront resources back to Terraform

## Benefits of Current Setup

‚úÖ **No CloudFront verification required**
‚úÖ **Much simpler configuration**
‚úÖ **Lower AWS costs**
‚úÖ **Faster deployments**
‚úÖ **Perfect for portfolio websites**
‚úÖ **Easy to upgrade to CloudFront later**

## Limitations of Current Setup

‚ùå **HTTP only** (no HTTPS with custom domain)
‚ùå **No global CDN** (slower for users far from us-east-1)
‚ùå **No custom domain** (must use S3 URL)

## How to Deploy

Your workflow is triggered by:
- Pushes to `main` branch
- Pull requests (if `DEPLOY_ON_PR=true`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

The workflow will:
1. Build your project with `npx nx build container`
2. Sync files to S3 with `aws s3 sync`
3. Display the website URL

## Manual Deployment (if needed)

```bash
# Build the project
npx nx build container

# Sync to S3 (requires AWS CLI configured)
aws s3 sync apps/container/dist/ s3://thommf-portfolio-personal-site/ --delete
```

Your portfolio is now ready for S3-only hosting! üöÄ
